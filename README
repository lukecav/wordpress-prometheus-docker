NOTES:

Progress so far is a working docker-compose set up for Prometheus, MariaDB, and WordPress.
This can be started with the command:
    docker-compose up

The wordpress website should then be available on http://localhost:8080 (already running/working)
Prometheus is not yet configured to monitor anything.

Untested code in ansible-aws.yml is intended to be used to deploy this docker-compose set up straight to an AWS EC2 instance.

TODO:

Split prometheus away from the wordpress/mysql app
Make prometheus monitor the EC2 server and web app
Test and verify the ansible-aws.yml code works
